        The climate crisis is an existential threat to our society.  
        For this reason, I volunteered for nearly one year organizing strikes and other events of Fridays for Future Karlsruhe.  
        During the time I helped in both, event organization and policy development.  
        However, due to limited time resources, I had to cut down on my activities since 2020.
