This project was part of the KIT Course on Practical Software Engineering.
In a team of 5 students we developed a web app for the creation, generation and verification of students' curricula.
The project consisted of a Java bases REST-API which was accessed by a Javascript based WebApp. The data was stored in a MySQL database using Hybernate.

My friend Hannes Kuchelmeister did a short video on what our tool was capable of:
