In this project with 5 students at ENSIMAG, Grenoble we had to develop a compiler for a subset of [Deca](https://code.google.com/archive/p/decac/).
The project tought us a number of lessons, both, on software engineering and management as well as on compiler construction.
The compiler was implemented in Java using ANTLR.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to publish the resulting work due to copyright restrictions.
