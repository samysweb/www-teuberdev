abstract: |2-
  Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only a suitable tool for code generation but also capable of generating annotation-based code specifications. Scaling these methodologies may allow us to deduce provable correctness guarantees for large-scale software systems. In comparison to other LLM tasks, the application field of deductive verification has the notable advantage of providing a rigorous toolset to check LLM-generated solutions. This short paper provides early results on how this rigorous toolset can be used to reliably elicit correct specification annotations from an unreliable LLM oracle. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We evaluate the effectiveness of feedback provided to a Large Language Model by the theorem prover KeY for verification of Java software using LLM-generated auxilliary annotations.
