  This article presents a formal model and formal safety proofs for the ABZ'25 case study in differential dynamic logic (dL). The case study considers an autonomous car driving on a highway avoiding collisions with neighbouring cars. Using KeYmaera X's dL implementation, we prove absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which ensures that safety is preserved independently of trip length. The safety guarantees hold for time-varying reaction time and brake force. Our dL model considers the single lane scenario with cars ahead or behind. We demonstrate that dL with its tools is a rigorous foundation for runtime monitoring, shielding, and neural network verification. Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the provided specification and simulation environment highway-env of the ABZ'25 study. We attempt to fix these inconsistencies and uncover numerous counterexamples which also indicate issues in the provided reinforcement learning environment.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We apply differential dynamic (refinement) logic to a case study on neural highway control. After modelling the abstract system we use VerSAILLE and the NCubeV tool [NeurIPS24] to (dis)prove the safety of concrete neural networks. Along the way we uncover numerous interesting results on the highway-env simulation environment including inconsistencies between the provided specification and the actual simulation.

   caption: "The ABZ'25 Case Study Challenge featured a neural network controlled car. Our contribution solves this case study based on the rigorous foundations of differential dynamic logic in combination with neural network verification as described in our recent NeurIPS'24 paper: We prove safety for the abstract model and derive specifications for the neural network."
   #Based on a valid dL-contract, VerSAILLE produces NN verification properties that allow the verification of infinite-time safety. In order to verify such properties, we require a tool for the verification of nonlinear properties on neural network -- this is the task of our new tool Mosaic.
