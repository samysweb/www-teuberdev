This blog post represents a collection of blog posts I have written in various blogs and on various platforms since the year 2011.
I now keep those blog posts here as a sort of *thought archive* and might extend them with further thoughts as I go along.
I have put these blog posts here *as is* -- without any (sometimes badly needed) spell checks, censorship or commentary. Current opinions may deviate from the opinions expressed in old blog entries.
