## Before 2022
During my Master's studies, I had a job as a student teaching assistant for the course [Programmierparadigmen](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/lehre/WS202021/paradigmen/uebung/) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
In particular, I was responsible for the weekly tutoriums, the materials of which can be found here (in German):
