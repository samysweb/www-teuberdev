My name is Samuel Teuber and I am a Master Student of Computer Science at KIT, Karlsruhe.
I have previously obtained a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science at KIT and spent a year abroad in Grenoble, France through the ERASMUS programme.

I am interested in theoretical computer science with a focus on formal methods applied to software and machine learning verification.
I am also a student assistant in a course on programming paradigms at KIT, Karlsruhe.
