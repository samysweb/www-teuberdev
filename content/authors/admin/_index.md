I am a Doctoral Researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology advised by [Bernhard Beckert](https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/beckert) at the [Application-oriented Formal Verification](https://formal.kastel.kit.edu) group.
I'm interested in formal methods for software and machine learning verification
with a focus on cyber-physical systems and algorithmic fairness.

I previously obtained a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from KIT and completed my Master's Thesis in the [Logical Systems Lab](https://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [André Platzer](https://lfcps.org/andre.html).
During my bachelor studies I spent a year abroad at ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France) and
participated in the [CERN Openlab Summer Student Program](https://openlab.cern/education/cern-openlab-summer-student-programme) (Geneva, Switzerland).
